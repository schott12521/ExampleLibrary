# compose-cupertino

This is a fork of [alexzhirkevich/compose-cupertino](https://github.com/alexzhirkevich/compose-cupertino) except its been updated to work with CMP 1.7+

Additionally this repo has automated builds to enable faster releases, to take advantage of new compose multiplatform features as they become available.

## New features (compared to the OG `compose-cupertino`)

- Updated SwipeBox
- Fixed Cupertino Date Picker implementations to interact with scrolling correctly
